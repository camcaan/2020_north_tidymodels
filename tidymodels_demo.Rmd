```

Load `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` libraries and set the theme (optional).

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)         # for reading in data, graphing, and cleaning
library(tidymodels)        # for modeling
library(moderndive)        # for King County housing data
theme_set(theme_minimal()) # my favorite ggplot2 theme :)
```

Read in the King County Housing data and take a look at the first 5 rows.

```{r}
data("house_prices")

house_prices %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```


According to the `house_prices` documentation, "This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/data)." The description of the variables in the dataset in the documentation seem to be a little off. A more accurate description is provided in the image below.
